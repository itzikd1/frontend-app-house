# TODO: Add PWA Support Plan

## Goals
- Transform the Angular app into a Progressive Web App (PWA).
- Enable offline support, installability, and improved performance.
- Follow best practices for PWA implementation and Angular style rules.

## Steps

1. **Audit Current State**
   - Check for existing PWA-related files (e.g., `manifest.webmanifest`, `ngsw-config.json`).
   - Review current service worker and manifest setup.

2. **Install Angular PWA Package**
   - Run: `ng add @angular/pwa` to add official Angular PWA support.
   - Verify changes to `angular.json`, `manifest.webmanifest`, and service worker files.

3. **Configure Manifest**
   - Update `manifest.webmanifest` with app name, icons, theme color, and start URL.
   - Ensure all required icon sizes are present in `public/icons/`.

4. **Configure Service Worker**
   - Edit `ngsw-config.json` for asset caching, data groups, and navigation fallback.
   - Set up caching strategies for API calls and static assets.

5. **Test Offline Functionality**
   - Build and serve the app in production mode.
   - Test offline access, installability, and update flow in Chrome DevTools.

6. **Add PWA Features**
   - Add install prompt and update notification logic in the app.
   - Handle service worker updates and prompt users to refresh.
   - Add custom splash screen and theme color.

7. **Accessibility & UX**
   - Ensure PWA features do not break accessibility.
   - Test on multiple devices and browsers.

8**Linting & Style**
   - Ensure all new code follows project linting and style rules.
   - Remove unused or deprecated PWA code.

9**Documentation**
    - Document PWA setup, update flow, and troubleshooting steps for maintainers.

**Note:**
Start with the official Angular PWA package, then customize manifest and service worker as needed. Always validate changes with tests and linting.
